### Tinyman - Algorand Standard Assets List

We are collecting all the icons of projects built on Algorand in one place where everyone can easily access. In this public repository you can check and add the icons of Algorand Standard Assets. Please pay attention to the rules and guidelines written below while adding an asset.

Note: This list and Tinyman app are still not working dynamically. This repository is currently just a place where we collect assets.


### How to?

When adding an asset in the asa-list folder, please create a new folder for the asset first. This folder's name should be `unit_name-asset_id`, e.g. "USDC-31566704" without adding any space.

After creating this folder, add the `.svg` and `.png` versions of the asset's icon. These images' sizes should be 256x256px and their names should be `icon.svg` and `icon.png`. (Remember that these icons will mostly be used in circular areas and arrange your icons accordingly.)

If you think that the asset you added is suitable for the use of icons in circular areas and you paid attention to folder naming, you can open a pull request.
